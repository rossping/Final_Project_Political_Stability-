# Introduction 

# Background

# The Data
  + Our data comes from The World Bank and contains a total of 213 countries. The dataset provides estimates on political stability for each country from 1996 to 2019. The World Bank calculates their metric of political stability based on the absence of violence and terrorism within a given country. The political stability metric is measured on a scale from -2.5 to 2.5, with negative values indicating weak stability and positive values indicating strong stability. 
  
  + The cleaned political stability dataset is merged with additional datasets from The World Bank, containing our predictor variables. This includes The World Bank's datasets on: population, fuel exports, military expenditure, ease of conducting business, inflation rate, literacy rate, and access to electricity.
